# Commute Compute System™

## Complete Project Overview

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** January 2026

# Executive Summary

I built **Commute Compute System™** as a fully self-hosted smart transit display for Australian public transport. It delivers real-time journey information to e-ink displays, answering the daily questions every commuter faces: "When should I leave?", "Is my train delayed?", "Do I have time for coffee?", and "Should I bring an umbrella?"

I designed the system to be completely free to deploy, require zero ongoing costs, and respect user privacy by keeping all data on the user's own server.

# Part 2: Vision & Goals

## The Problem I Wanted to Solve

Every morning, I faced the same uncertainty:

- "When should I leave?" — Depends on real-time delays
- "Is my train delayed?" — Had to check multiple apps
- "Do I have time for coffee?" — Mental math every day
- "Should I bring an umbrella?" — Another app to check

I wanted a single glance at an e-ink display to answer all of these.

## Core Principles I Followed

| Principle | How I Implemented It |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Privacy First** | All data stays on user's own server |
| **Truly Free** | Runs entirely on Vercel free tier |
| **Zero Dependencies** | Custom firmware connects only to user's server |
| **Australian Focus** | Built for VIC, NSW, QLD transit systems |
| **Open Source** | All code freely available |

## Brands I Created

| Brand | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Commute Compute System™** | Overall system name |
| **SmartCommute™** | Journey calculation engine |
| **CCDash™** | Dashboard rendering specification |
| **CC LiveDash™** | Multi-device live renderer |
| **CCFirm™** | Custom firmware family |

# Part 3: Technical Challenges I Solved

## Challenge 1: E-ink Display Constraints

### The Problem I Faced

E-ink displays have severe limitations:

- 1-bit color only (pure black and white)
- Slow refresh (2-3 seconds full refresh)
- Ghosting from previous images
- No anti-aliasing possible

### How I Solved It

I implemented **server-side rendering** with **zone-based partial refresh**:

```
My Zone Layout (800x480 display):

+----------------------------------+
| HEADER (0-94px)                  |  <- Updates for time/weather
+----------------------------------+
| SUMMARY (96-124px)               |  <- Updates for status
+----------------------------------+
| JOURNEY LEGS (132-448px)         |  <- Updates for delays
+----------------------------------+
| FOOTER (448-480px)               |  <- Rarely updates
+----------------------------------+

Each zone refreshes independently.
Full cycle: 20 seconds.
Partial refresh: ~500ms per zone.
```

## Challenge 2: ESP32-C3 Memory Constraints

### The Problem I Faced

The TRMNL device uses an ESP32-C3 with severe limitations:

- Only 400KB RAM total
- No external PSRAM
- Single core processor
- Very easy to brick with wrong code

### How I Solved It

I developed a **zone batching** approach and **12 anti-brick rules**:

```
FORBIDDEN (causes brick):
  - deepSleep() in setup()
  - Network calls in setup()
  - Delays longer than 2 seconds
  - Watchdog timer enabled

REQUIRED (safe pattern):
  - setup() completes in <5 seconds
  - State machine in loop()
  - Non-blocking operations only
  - Brownout detection disabled
```

I documented all 12 rules in DEVELOPMENT-RULES.md Appendix D.

## Challenge 3: Zero-Config Serverless Deployment

### The Problem I Faced

- Users should never edit environment variables
- Vercel serverless has no persistent storage
- Each request is completely stateless
- API keys need to be secure but accessible

### How I Solved It

I created a **Config Token Architecture** where all configuration is encoded in the URL:

```
SETUP TIME:
  User enters data in Setup Wizard
            |
            v
  All config encoded to base64 token
            |
            v
  Token becomes part of device URL

RUNTIME:
  Device requests: /api/device/eyJhIjp7...
            |
            v
  Server decodes token from URL
            |
            v
  All config available instantly
            |
            v
  No storage needed!
```

Token structure I designed:

```
{
  "a": addresses,
  "l": lat/lng locations (cached),
  "s": state (VIC/NSW/QLD),
  "t": arrival time,
  "c": coffee enabled,
  "k": transit API key,
  "cf": cached cafe data,
  "m": API mode
}
```

---

## Challenge 4: Free-Tier Architecture

### The Problem I Faced

- Google Places API costs ~$0.02 per call
- I didn't want users to need paid APIs
- But address autocomplete significantly improves UX

### How I Solved It

I implemented **setup-time caching** with **free fallbacks**:

```
FREE MODE (default):
  - OSM Nominatim for geocoding (free)
  - Default cafe hours (free)
  - All data cached at setup time
  - $0 runtime cost

LIVE MODE (optional):
  - Google Places for geocoding
  - Real cafe business hours
  - Only for users who want it
```

---

## Challenge 5: Multi-State Transit APIs

### The Problem I Faced

Each Australian state has different transit APIs:

- Different authentication methods
- Different data formats
- Different rate limits

### How I Solved It

I built the **SmartCommute™ Engine** as a unified abstraction:

```
State     | Authority          | Auth Method
----------|-------------------|------------------
VIC       | Transport Victoria | KeyId header (UUID)
NSW       | Transport for NSW  | Authorization header
QLD       | TransLink          | X-API-Key header
```

The engine handles all state-specific logic internally. Users just specify their state.

---

## Challenge 6: Real-Time Disruption Handling

### The Problem I Faced

- Services get suspended (signal faults)
- Trams get diverted (roadworks)
- Trains get cancelled
- Users need to know immediately

### How I Solved It

I implemented **automatic route adaptation**:

```
NORMAL JOURNEY:
  Walk -> Train -> Walk

SIGNAL FAULT DETECTED:
  Walk -> [SUSPENDED] -> Walk
              |
              v
  System auto-inserts replacement:
  Walk -> Rail Replacement Bus -> Train -> Walk

DISPLAY SHOWS:
  "DISRUPTION -> Arrive 8:52 (+18 min)"
  [Diagonal stripes on cancelled service]
  [Rail replacement automatically added]
```

---

## Challenge 7: The Coffee Decision

### The Problem I Faced

- Users want coffee but don't want to be late
- Coffee time varies (5-15 minutes)
- Should skip coffee if running late
- Different patterns needed (origin, interchange, destination)

### How I Solved It

I built the **CoffeeDecision Engine**:

```
INPUTS:
  - Current time
  - Journey duration
  - Target arrival time
  - Coffee duration preference
  - Cafe business hours (cached)
  - Current delays

DECISION LOGIC:
  IF coffee_enabled
  AND cafe_is_open
  AND (journey + coffee + delays) <= arrival_buffer
  THEN
    -> Insert coffee leg
    -> Status: "TIME FOR COFFEE"
  
  ELSE IF delays_detected
  AND would_be_late_with_coffee
  THEN
    -> Skip coffee leg
    -> Status: "SKIP - Running late"
```

## Challenge 8: bb_epaper Library Bugs

### The Problem I Faced

After weeks of debugging, I discovered ESP32-C3 specific bugs:

- `allocBuffer()` causes garbage display
- `FONT_12x16` renders text rotated 90°
- No documentation existed for these issues

### How I Solved It

I documented my findings and implemented workarounds:

```
BROKEN (causes garbage):
  bbep.allocBuffer(true);
  bbep.setBuffer(buf);

WORKING (what I use):
  bbep.fillScreen(BBEP_WHITE);
  bbep.setFont(FONT_8x8);  // NOT FONT_12x16!
  bbep.drawString("Hello", 0, 0);
  bbep.refresh(REFRESH_FULL, true);
```

I added all findings to DEVELOPMENT-RULES.md Appendix D.

---

## Challenge 9: Vercel Serverless Font Rendering

### The Problem I Faced

- Vercel serverless functions have no system fonts
- `canvas.fillText()` silently fails
- Text renders as completely blank

### How I Solved It

I bundled fonts and registered them explicitly:

```javascript
// I register fonts BEFORE any canvas operations
GlobalFonts.registerFromPath(
  './fonts/Inter-Bold.ttf', 
  'Inter'
);

// Now I use the registered font name
ctx.font = '800 17px Inter';
// NOT 'sans-serif' - that fails silently!
```

---

## Challenge 10: iOS Safari Compatibility

### The Problem I Faced

- Safari validates forms even with `novalidate`
- Relative URLs fail on mobile Safari
- Pattern validation throws errors

### How I Solved It

I added explicit attributes on all form elements:

```html
<!-- Required for iOS Safari -->
<input type="text" 
       autocomplete="off" 
       inputmode="text">

<button type="button" formnovalidate>
  Submit
</button>

<!-- Always use absolute URLs -->
const url = window.location.origin + '/api/endpoint';
```

  | GitHub    |  Fork   | User's    | Deploy  | Vercel    |
  | Public    | ------> | Copy      | ------> | (Free)    |
  +-----------+         +-----------+         +-----+-----+
                                                    |
                                                    v
                                              +-----------+
                                              | User's    |
                                              | E-ink     |
                                              | Display   |
                                              +-----------+

KEY BENEFITS:
  - Complete data isolation
  - User owns all API keys

# Summary

I built **Commute Compute System™** over 18 months, solving real problems:

- **76,445 lines of code** across 176 files
- **10 major technical challenges** solved
- **3 Australian states** supported
- **9 device types** compatible
- **Zero ongoing costs** for users
- **Complete privacy** — data stays on user's server

The system succeeds when a commuter can glance at their e-ink display, see "LEAVE NOW — Coffee included", and walk out the door knowing they'll catch their train on time.
