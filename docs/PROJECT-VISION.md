## Project Statement

> **The FIRST travel planner that intelligently factors in your LIFESTYLE to your journey; Commute Compute does all of the thinking for you.**

This statement defines the scope and intellectual property of the Commute Compute System™ project.

## Vision Statement

**Commute Compute System™ aims to be the definitive open-source smart transit display for Australian public transport** — empowering commuters with real-time journey information on beautiful e-ink displays, while maintaining complete privacy and user control.

## Core Values

### 🔒 Privacy First
Your commute data stays on YOUR server. No tracking, no analytics, no central database. Each user owns their complete stack.

### 🆓 Truly Free
Runs entirely on free-tier infrastructure (Vercel). No subscriptions, no hidden costs, no premium features locked behind paywalls. Optional paid APIs (Google Places) have free fallbacks.

### 🔌 Zero Dependencies
No reliance on third-party clouds or services. CCFirm™ custom firmware means your device connects only to your server — not to usetrmnl.com or any other external service.

### 🇦🇺 Australian Focus
Purpose-built for Australian public transport systems. Full support for Victoria (Transport Victoria OpenData API), with NSW and Queensland supported and architecture designed for all states/territories.

### 📖 Open Source
All code, specifications, and documentation freely available under AGPL v3. Community contributions welcome.

## Architecture Principles

### Server-Side Rendering
All computation happens on the server. The device is "dumb" — it receives images and displays them. This enables:
- Minimal firmware complexity
- Easy updates (server-side only)
- Low device memory requirements
- Consistent rendering across devices

### Zero-Config Deployment
Users should never need to edit environment variables or configuration files. All configuration happens through the Setup Wizard and is embedded in URL tokens.

### Self-Hosted Only
No central server, no shared infrastructure, no SaaS model. Each user deploys their own complete stack. This ensures:
- Complete privacy
- No single point of failure
- User ownership of data
- Unlimited scaling (each user pays their own hosting)

### Specification-Driven Development
All UI and behaviour is defined in locked specifications (CCDash™ V10). Changes require explicit approval and version bumps. This prevents:
- UI inconsistency
- Scope creep
- Breaking changes
- Developer confusion

### Free-Tier First
The entire system must be usable for free. Paid APIs (Google Places) are optional with free fallbacks (OSM Nominatim). No feature should require payment.

## Conclusion

Commute Compute System™ represents a commitment to privacy-respecting, user-empowering technology. By keeping everything self-hosted and open-source, we ensure that users truly own their smart transit experience — no strings attached.

The project succeeds when an Australian commuter can glance at their e-ink display, see "LEAVE NOW — Coffee included", and walk out the door knowing they'll catch their train on time.
