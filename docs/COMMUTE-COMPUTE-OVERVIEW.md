# Part 1: Vision & Goals

## What is Commute Compute?

**Commute Compute System™** is a fully self-hosted smart transit display for Australian public transport. It delivers real-time journey information to beautiful e-ink displays, helping commuters know exactly when to leave — including whether there's time for coffee.

### The Problem We Solve

Every morning, commuters face the same questions:
- "When should I leave?"
- "Is my train delayed?"
- "Do I have time for coffee?"
- "Should I bring an umbrella?"

Commute Compute answers all of these at a glance on a dedicated e-ink display.

### Core Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Privacy First** | Your data stays on YOUR server. No tracking, no analytics. |
| **Truly Free** | Runs on Vercel free tier. No subscriptions or hidden costs. |
| **Zero Dependencies** | Custom firmware connects only to your server — not to any cloud. |
| **Australian Focus** | Built for Australian transit: VIC, NSW, QLD supported. |
| **Open Source** | All code freely available under AGPL v3. |

# Part 2: System Architecture

## Self-Hosted Distribution Model

Every user deploys their own complete stack. There is no central server.

### Why Self-Hosted?

1. **Privacy**: Your commute patterns never leave your server
2. **Reliability**: No single point of failure
3. **Cost**: Vercel free tier is sufficient
4. **Control**: You own everything

# Part 3: The SmartCommute™ Engine

## How It Works

The SmartCommute™ engine is the brain of Commute Compute. It calculates optimal journeys by:

1. **Fetching real-time data** from transit authorities (GTFS-RT)
2. **Detecting delays and disruptions** from service alerts
3. **Calculating multi-modal routes** (walk → tram → train → walk)
4. **Inserting coffee stops** when timing permits
5. **Adapting to disruptions** with alternative routes

### Key Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Real-time delays** | Shows actual delay in minutes (+5 MIN, +10 MIN) |
| **Service alerts** | Detects suspensions, diversions, cancellations |
| **Coffee decision** | Calculates if you have time for coffee |
| **Multi-modal** | Combines walk, train, tram, bus seamlessly |
| **Express detection** | Identifies express services that save time |
| **Weather integration** | Shows temperature and umbrella recommendation |

---

## CoffeeDecision Logic

The engine determines whether to include a coffee stop based on:

1. **Is coffee enabled?** (user preference)
2. **Is the cafe open?** (cached business hours)
3. **Will we still arrive on time?** (with coffee duration added)
4. **Should we skip due to delays?** (smart skip when running late)

### Coffee Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Origin** | Coffee before leaving (near home) |
| **Interchange** | Coffee at a transfer point |
| **Destination** | Coffee near work |
| **Skip** | No coffee when running late |

---

# Part 4: Dashboard Scenarios

The following images demonstrate how the SmartCommute™ engine handles various real-world scenarios. Each dashboard is rendered server-side and delivered to the e-ink display.

# Part 5: Setup & Deployment

## Zero-Config Architecture

Users never need to edit environment variables. All configuration happens through the Setup Wizard and is encoded into a URL token.

```
SETUP (one-time)                    RUNTIME (automatic)
────────────────                    ──────────────────
1. Enter addresses          →       All data cached in URL:
2. Geocode locations        →       • Home/work/cafe lat/lon
3. Select transit authority →       • API keys
4. Enter preferences        →       • Coffee settings
5. Generate webhook URL     →       • State selection
                                    
Device fetches from YOUR URL with embedded config.
No server-side storage required.
```

# Summary

Commute Compute System™ is a privacy-respecting, fully self-hosted smart transit display that:

1. **Shows real-time departures** from Australian transit authorities
2. **Calculates optimal routes** across multiple transport modes
3. **Decides if you have time for coffee** based on your schedule
4. **Adapts to delays and disruptions** automatically
5. **Runs for free** on Vercel with no ongoing costs
6. **Protects your privacy** — your data never leaves your server

The project succeeds when a Melbourne commuter can glance at their e-ink display, see "LEAVE NOW — Coffee included", and walk out the door knowing they'll catch their train on time.
