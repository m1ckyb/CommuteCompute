## 🎯 Overview: What We're Going To Do

Here's the big picture. We're going to do 5 main things:

```
Step 1: Get Your Free API Keys        ⏱️ 10 minutes
        └─ We'll sign up for free accounts

Step 2: Set Up Your Server            ⏱️ 15 minutes
        └─ This is where your data lives (it's free!)

Step 3: Flash Your Display            ⏱️ 10 minutes
        └─ Put the software on your device

Step 4: Connect to WiFi               ⏱️ 5 minutes
        └─ Let your display talk to the internet

Step 5: Configure Your Preferences    ⏱️ 10 minutes
        └─ Tell it what trains/trams you want to see
```

**Total time: About 50 minutes**

Don't worry - we'll do these one at a time, and you can take breaks!

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Get Your Free API Keys

**What is this?** API keys are like permission slips that let our program get real-time train data. They're completely free!

### 1.1 Get Your PTV OpenData API Key (Required)

**⏱️ Time: 5-10 minutes**

**What is PTV?** Public Transport Victoria - they provide all the train/tram/bus data!

1. **Open your browser** and go to: https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/data-and-reporting/datasets/ptv-timetable-api/

2. **Click "Get Your API Key"** or scroll down to find the registration form

3. **Fill in the form:**
   - Your name
   - Your email address
   - Reason: "Personal project - transit display"

4. **Submit the form**

5. **Check your email** - You'll get an email within a few minutes with:
   - Your **API Key** (looks like: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)
   - Your **Developer ID** (a long number)

6. **📝 IMPORTANT: Write these down!**
   - Create a text file on your desktop called "ptv-keys.txt"
   - Copy and paste both keys into this file
   - Save it - you'll need these later!

**✅ Success Check:** You should have two long codes saved in a text file.

**❓ Having trouble?**
- Email not arriving? Check your spam folder
- Form not working? Try a different browser (Chrome/Firefox)
- Need help? The PTV help desk is friendly: data@ptv.vic.gov.au

---

### 1.2 Get Google Places API Key (Optional - Makes Cafe Search Better)

**Can I skip this?** Yes! The system works without it. Google Places just makes finding your favorite cafe easier.

**⏱️ Time: 5 minutes**

**What is this?** Google Places helps you search for cafes by name (like "Everyday Coffee" instead of typing the full address).

1. **Go to:** https://console.cloud.google.com/

2. **Sign in** with your Google account (Gmail)

3. **Create a new project:**
   - Click "Select a project" at the top
   - Click "New Project"
   - Name it: "commute-compute"
   - Click "Create"

4. **Enable Places API:**
   - In the search bar, type "Places API"
   - Click on "Places API"
   - Click "Enable"

5. **Create an API key:**
   - Go to "Credentials" in the left menu
   - Click "Create Credentials" → "API Key"
   - Copy the key that appears

6. **📝 Save your key:**
   - Add this to your "ptv-keys.txt" file
   - Label it: "Google Places Key: [paste key here]"

**✅ Success Check:** You have a third key saved (optional).

**❓ Having trouble?**
- **Google account needed** - If you don't have one, this step is optional
- **Credit card required?** - Google asks for one but won't charge for normal use (we use very few API calls)
- **Want to skip it?** - Absolutely fine! The system works great without it

## 🌐 Step 2: Set Up Your Server (The Easy Way!)

**What is this?** Your "server" is where all the magic happens - it fetches train times and creates the image for your display. We're using Render.com which is **free** and takes care of everything!

**⏱️ Time: 15 minutes**

### 2.1 Create a Render Account

1. **Go to:** https://render.com/

2. **Click "Get Started"** (top right)

3. **Sign up using GitHub:**
   - Click "Sign up with GitHub"
   - Create a GitHub account if you don't have one (it's free!)
   - Authorize Render to access GitHub

**✅ Success Check:** You're now logged into Render.com

---

### 2.2 Fork the Repository

**What's a "fork"?** Think of it like making your own copy of the software that you can customize.

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/angusbergman17-cpu/CommuteCompute

2. **Click the "Fork" button** (top right)

3. **Click "Create Fork"**

**✅ Success Check:** You now have your own copy at: `github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/CommuteCompute`

---

### 2.3 Deploy to Render

**This is where it all comes together!**

1. **Go back to Render.com** (in your browser)

2. **Click "New +" → "Web Service"**

3. **Connect your GitHub repository:**
   - Click "Connect account" if needed
   - Find "CommuteCompute" in the list
   - Click "Connect"

4. **Configure your service:**

   Fill in these fields exactly as shown:

   - **Name:** `commute-compute` (or any name you like)
   - **Region:** Choose closest to Melbourne (Singapore or Sydney)
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Root Directory:** Leave blank
   - **Runtime:** `Node`
   - **Build Command:** `npm install`
   - **Start Command:** `npm start`
   - **Plan:** `Free`

5. **Add your API keys as Environment Variables:**

   Click "Advanced" → "Add Environment Variable"

   Add these THREE variables (get them from your ptv-keys.txt file):

   ```
   ODATA_API_KEY = [Your PTV Developer ID]
   ODATA_TOKEN = [Your PTV API Key]
   NODE_ENV = production
   ```

   If you have Google Places (optional):
   ```
   GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY = [Your Google Places Key]
   ```

6. **Click "Create Web Service"**

7. **Wait for deployment:**
   - You'll see a log screen with scrolling text
   - This takes 3-5 minutes
   - ✅ When you see "Server running on port 3000" - you're done!

8. **Copy your URL:**
   - At the top, you'll see a URL like: `https://your-server-name.vercel.app`
   - 📝 **Save this!** This is your server address
   - Add it to your ptv-keys.txt file as "Server URL: [paste url]"

**✅ Success Check:**
- Visit your URL in a browser
- You should see a page with links (Admin Panel, Setup Wizard, etc.)
- It might take 30 seconds to wake up the first time - this is normal!

**❓ Having trouble?**
- **Build failed?** - Check that all environment variables are spelled exactly right (no extra spaces)
- **Server not starting?** - Look at the logs for red error messages - usually it's a missing API key
- **URL not loading?** - Render free tier "sleeps" after 15 minutes of no use - just wait 30 seconds and refresh

---

## 📱 Step 3: Flash Your Display (Put Software On The Device)

**What is this?** "Flashing" means putting our software onto your physical device. It's like installing an app, but for hardware.

**⏱️ Time: 10 minutes**

**🎯 IMPORTANT:** Use Chrome or Edge browser for this step. Firefox and Safari don't support the Web Serial API we need.

### Method 1: Use Our Automated Web Tool (Easiest!)

1. **Connect your device:**
   - Plug your TRMNL display into your computer with the USB cable
   - Turn it on if it has a power switch

2. **Go to your server URL:**
   - Open: `https://[your-render-url]/admin/setup-wizard`
   - You should see "Step 5: Device Setup"
   - Click through to Step 5 if you're on Step 1

3. **Download the firmware:**
   - Scroll down to "Firmware File"
   - Click the "Download Latest Firmware" button
   - Save the `.bin` file to your Downloads folder

4. **Use the Web Flasher:**
   - Go to: https://esp.huhn.me/ (ESP32 Web Flasher tool)
   - Click "Connect"
   - Select your device from the popup (it might say "USB Serial" or "CP210x")
   - Click "Choose File" and select the `.bin` file you downloaded
   - Click "Program"
   - Wait for the progress bar to reach 100% (about 2 minutes)

5. **Done!**
   - You'll see "Programming successful!"
   - Unplug and replug your device

**✅ Success Check:** The device restarts and shows "WiFi Setup" or a configuration screen.

---

### Method 2: Command Line (For Linux/Mac Users)

**If you're comfortable with Terminal:**

```bash
# Install esptool
pip install esptool

# Download firmware from your server
curl https://[your-render-url]/firmware/firmware.bin > firmware.bin

# Flash (replace /dev/ttyUSB0 with your port)
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash 0x0 firmware.bin
```

---

**❓ Having trouble?**

**"Can't find my device"**
- **Windows:** Install CH340 or CP210x USB drivers
- **Mac:** Some cables are charge-only - try a different USB cable
- **Linux:** You might need to add yourself to the `dialout` group: `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`

**"Permission denied"**
- **Linux/Mac:** Run with `sudo`
- **Windows:** Run browser as Administrator

**"Verification failed"**
- Try unplugging and replugging the device
- Hold the "BOOT" button while connecting (some ESP32 boards)

**⏱️ Time: 5 minutes**

**This is the easy part!**

### 4.1 Access Configuration Portal

1. **After flashing, your device creates a WiFi network:**
   - Look for a WiFi network called "TRMNL-Setup" or "ESP32-Setup"
   - Connect to it from your phone or computer
   - Password (if asked): `12345678`

2. **A webpage should open automatically**
   - If it doesn't, open a browser and go to: `http://192.168.4.1`

3. **Configure WiFi:**
   - Click "Configure WiFi"
   - Select your home WiFi network from the list
   - Enter your WiFi password
   - Click "Save"
