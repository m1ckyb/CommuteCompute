## [2026-02-01] — Firmware v6.1 Logo Fix

### Fixed
- **BMP Logo Rendering Artifacts** — Eliminated black vertical bars on boot/setup screens
- Root cause: BMP row padding. 1-bit BMPs pad rows to 32-bit boundaries; bb_epaper rendered padding bits as black lines
- Solution: All logo widths must be multiples of 32

### Changed
- Boot logo: 256×380 (full "COMMUTE COMPUTE" branding, properly centered)
- Small logo: 128×130 (for connecting/setup screens)
- Source logos auto-trimmed from original 1056×992 master

### Firmware
- **v6.1-60s** — LOCKED, tagged as `v6.1-logos-fixed`
- Clean boot sequence: CC logo → Connecting → Setup/Dashboard

### Documentation
- ARCHITECTURE.md Section 11 — Added BMP rendering requirements
- Development Rules — BMP width alignment documented

## [2026-02-01] — Device Pairing with Vercel KV

### Added
- **Device Pairing System** — 6-character code pairing (like Chromecast/Roku)
- **Vercel KV Integration** for pairing — persistent storage across serverless invocations
- **Visual Logic Audit** — 10-point V11 compliance checking (`npm run monitor:visual`)
- **Security Audit** — XSS vulnerability scanning, API key validation
- **Firmware Audit** — 12-point anti-brick compliance checking

### Changed
- Dashboard spec updated from V10 to **CCDash V11** (LOCKED 2026-01-31)
- Architecture updated to v5.3
- Development Rules updated to v1.19
- Setup Wizard redirect message: "Directing you to your dashboard now..."

### Fixed
- Pairing API now uses Vercel KV — in-memory stores failed across serverless cold starts
- Device polling now correctly receives webhookUrl from persistent storage

### Documentation
- DEVELOPMENT-RULES.md Section 21.6 — Device Pairing System
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md Section 18 — Updated with Vercel KV flow
- README.md — Updated badges and architecture diagram
